# Finally, note the two port numbers after each server name: " 2888" and "3888". Peers use the 
# former port to connect to other peers.Such a connection is necessary so that peers can communicate, 
# for example, to agree upon the order of updates.More specifically, a ZooKeeper server uses this 
# port to connect followers to the leader. When a new leader arises, a follower opens a TCP connection 
# to the leader using this port. Because the default leader election also uses TCP, we currently 
# require another port for leader election. This is the second port in the server entry.
